# Complexity

---

"even among scientists, there is no unique definition of complexity – and the scientific notion has traditionally been conveyed using particular examples..."
- Neil johnson ( Physicist & Author of Simply Complexity" )

## What makes something complex ?

### How humans deal with it ?

---

## One example with points on a surface (simple 2D)

---

![](assets/complx_point.png)

## 1 point

---

![](assets/complx_points.png)

## 82 points (really ?)

---

![](assets/complx_color_points.png)


## 16 R, 17 G, 17 B, 30 N points (really ? more colors ?)

---

![](assets/complx_color_points_tri.png)

## 20 points (really ? more colors ?) in a triangle (really ? )


---


## Another example with shapes drawn on a surface (still simple 2D)

Note how we forget this is a fat blue line that makes what we decided to call a 'shape'
---


![](assets/complx_square.png)

## A square

---

![](assets/complx_shape.png)

## A square with a triangle on top and circle on right side

---

![](assets/complx_cplxshape.png)

## Something (???), looks like part of a circle on right side... a hand ? a country ?

---

![](assets/complx_chaoshape.png)

## No idea...

---

## What did we do ? we express what we see in language and :
- we simplify & omit details
- we decompose in smaller / simpler parts

---

## Simplification

Simplification can be useful or totally useless.

“Everything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler” - A. Einstein (E = mc2)

---

## Simplification requires a Context

If the context is unknown, it can make things harder to understand / more complex instead.

How about you did not know :

@ul[spaced]
- what a 'point' is ?
- what a '1' is ?
- what a 'G' is ?
@ulend

### Decomposition needs a "system"/"process" to recompose

This is what an "algorithm" is.
- Algorithms can also be very complex in themselves.
- Algorithms need a context in which they can be expressed simply enough

=> Algorithms need to be understood to be reused and be useful.

# Math

@ul[spaced]
- Science is the process of doubting everything to extract knowledge from the world.
- That knowledge can then be transferred to others so they can use it.
- Math is the toolbox to express that knowledge so it can be transferred.
@ulend

## Math as Mental representation

Math also helps to transfer knowledge from you *now*, to you *tomorrow*.
We do it instinctively all the time.
The trick is just to become aware of it.

---

## Math is everywhere. You already know it.

Do you know :

@ul[spaced]
- what '8' means ? 
- what 'VIII' means ? need context ?
- what '12 - 4' means ?
- what 'sqrt(64)' means ? need context ?
@ulend

## Advanced Math Knowledge is required in a complex world
 If we want to survive in a complex world

@ul[spaced]
- what does '1/2 * m * square(mv) means ? Physics
- what does ' CH4 + O2 -> 4H + CO2 ' means ? Chemistry
- what does '20 % of 10 euros' means ? Commerce
- what does ' if rain then take umbrella ' ? Everyday Logic
- ...
@ulend

## Math has a few simple theories from which others are derived.

- Arithmetic
- Logic
- Group Theory
- Set Theory
- ...

20th century : Foundational crisis in mathematics

---

##  A relatively (1945) recent challenger

Category Theory : 
- simple ( points and arrows )
- powerful ( many known theories have been derived from it already )


---

## Category Theory

Categories represent abstractions of other mathematical concepts. Many areas of mathematics can be formalised by category theory as categories. ( Wikipedia )

It can describe compositionality in a context (a category)
AND it can describe how to compose these contexts to form more complex contexts.

The category of all categories is a category *Cat*

## Take the time to think, ponder on 'stupid' questions :

@ul[spaced]
- what is 0 ? in roman numerals ?
- what is -2 apple ? why ?
- what is 4 parts of one cake ? what if I take 0.5 part ? double cake ?
@ulend

---

## Go Forth and Do Math

@ul[spaced]
- why is the sky blue ?
- why spaghetti are usually breaking in 3 or more pieces ?
- ...
