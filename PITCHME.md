# Complexity

---

"even among scientists, there is no unique definition of complexity – and the scientific notion has traditionally been conveyed using particular examples..."
- Neil johnson ( Physicist & Author of Simply Complexity" )

## What makes something complex ?

### How humans deal with it ?

---

## One example with points on a surface (the simple 2D case)

---

## 1 point

---


![](assets/complx_points.png)

## 82 points (really ?)


---


![](assets/complx_color_points.png)


## 16 R, 17 G, 17 B, 30 N points (really ? more colors ?)

---

![](assets/complx_color_points_tri.png)


## 20 points (really ? more colors ?) in a triangle (really ? )



---


## Another example with shapes drawn on a surface (still simple 2D)

Note how we forget this is a fat blue line that makes what we decided to call a 'shape'
---


![](assets/complx_square.png)

## A square

---

![](assets/complx_shape.png)

## A square with a triangle on top and circle on right side

---

![](assets/complx_cplxshape.png)

## Something (???), looks like part of a circle on right side... a hand ? a country ?

---

## No idea...

---

## What did we do ? we express what we see in language and :
- we simplify & omit details
- we decompose in smaller / simpler parts

---

## Simplification

Simplification can be useful or totally useless.

“Everything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler” - A. Einstein (E = mc2)

---

## Simplification requires a Context

If the context is unknown, it can make things harder to understand / more complex instead.

How about you did not know :
- what a 'point' is ?
- what a '1' is ? or '23' ? or ...

---

### Decomposition needs a "system"/"process" to recompose

This is what an "algorithm" is.
- Algorithms can also be very complex in themselves.
- Algorithms need a context in which they can be expressed simply enough

=> Algorithms need to be understood to be reused and be useful.

# Math

Science is the process of doubting everything to extract knowledge from the world.
That knowledge can then be transferred to others so they can use it.
Math is the toolbox to express that knowledge so it can be transferred.

---

## Math as Mental representation

Math also helps to transfer knowledge from you&now, to you&tomorrow.
We do it instinctively all the time, because it is the only way for us to "understand" things and survive.
The trick is just to become aware of it.

---

## Math is everywhere. You already know some of it.

Do you know : 
- what '8' means ? 
- what 'VIII' means ? need some context maybe ?
- what '12 - 4' means ?
- what 'sqrt(64)' means ? need some context maybe ?

---

## Advanced Math Knowledge is required in a complex world
 If we want to survive in a complex world
 
- what does '20 % of 10 euros' means ? it's the extra tax you pay when you buy something for 10 euros.
- what does '1/2 * m * square(mv) ? it is the damage done when a car crashes into a wall.
- ...

---

## Math has a few simple theories from which others are derived.

- Arithmetic
- Logic
- Group Theory
- Set Theory
- ...

20th century : Foundational crisis in mathematics

---

##  A relatively (1945) recent challenger

Category Theory : 
- simple ( object and morphisms / points and arrows )
- powerful ( many known theories have been derived from it already )

It can describe the essence of compositionality in a well defined context
AND it can describe how to compose these contexts together to form more complex contexts

---

## Take the time to think, ponder on 'stupid' questions :

- what is 0 in roman numerals ? why ?
- what is -2 apple ? why ?
- what is 4 parts of one cake ? what if I take 0.5 part ? double cake ?
- why when holding spaghetti on both sides and twisting your wrist, the spaghetti break in 3 pieces always ?
